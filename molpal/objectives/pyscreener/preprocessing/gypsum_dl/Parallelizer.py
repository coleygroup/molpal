Parallelizer.py

Abstract parallel computation utility.

The "parallelizer" object exposes a simple map interface that takes a function
and a list of arguments and returns the result of applying the function to
each argument. Internally, the parallelizer class can determine what parallel
capabilities are present on a system and automatically pick between "mpi",
"multiprocessing" or "serial" in order to speed up the map operation. This
approach simplifies development and allows the same program to run on a laptop
or a high-performance computer cluster, utilizing the full resources of each
system. (Description provided by Harrison Green.)
