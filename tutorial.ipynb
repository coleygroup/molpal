    "## 1. Utilizing distributed resources\n",
    "\n",
    "MolPAL is able to leverage distributed hardware allocations to parallelize each step in the optimization loop: (i) model training, (ii) prediction, and (iii) docking. To do so, it uses a [`ray`](ray.io) cluster on the backend. Before running MolPAL (step 5) or prefeaturizing the library (step 3), you must start a ray cluster. The setup details vary depending on your resource allocation, but there are two broad cases to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "### (A) local parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "This case is fairly simple. To start a local ray cluster, run the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ray start --head\n",
    "```\n",
    "from the command line. This will start a ray cluster on your machine with all available resources on your machine. If you would like to restrict MolPAL to only using some fraction of the resources on your machine, start the ray cluster like so:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ray start --head --num-cpus NUM_CPUS --num-gpus NUM_GPUS\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where `NUM_CPUS` and `NUM_GPUS` are the absolute number of CPUs and GPUs you'd like MolPAL to have access to during its run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (B) distributed parallelization on an HPC\n",
    "The `ray` libary allows MolPAL to be written such that the specific hardware setup makes no difference to the code/parallelization architecture of the source code. The only difference this causes is in the definition of the ray cluster. On an HPC, we may easily get access to multiple compute nodes over which to run a MolPAL job. Utilizing each of these nodes is very similar to the local cluster setup from above. We first start a ray cluster on the \"head\" node and then start a ray cluster on each worker node and connect these resources to the \"head\" node. The specific syntax of this proces will vary on the scheduling system of your HPC, but the concepts remain the same. Below is an excerpt from a SLURM submission script that connects all the nodes in a job to a single ray cluster. You can see this in the context of the full submission script [here](./run_molpal.batch)."

    "Another thing to consider in the impact of tautomers on docking results. It's possible that some of these compounds (maybe not these ones specifically) exist in an ensemble of tautomeric states, some of which bind preferentially to our protein of interest. Unfortunately, given that SMILES strings correspond to only one tautomer, we might miss them. We will need to enumerate all possible tautomers we would like to include, but we should be selective in which tautomers we enumerate first to avoid blowing up the size of our library. As a hypothetical example, let's consider that we have a number of 1,3-diketones in our library. These compounds can undergo a keto-enol tautomerization to form an intramolecular H-bonding interaction, like so:\n",

    "Both RF and NN models expect vector-based inputs (e.g., molecular fingerprints) for training and prediction. During startup, MolPAL will calculate the molecular fingerprint of each molecule in the library and store it in an HDF5 file to be reused throughout the optimization. However, if you plan to run multiple experiments with the same library, this featurization will be performed for each individual experiment. To avoid this, we can prefeaturize a virtual library using the [`fingerprints.py`](./scripts/fingerprints.py) script. This script utilizes a ray cluster (see [above](#1-utilizing-distributed-resources) on how to set one up) to parallelize this calculation.

For large amounts of compounds, it can be useful to help automate this process by (1) filtering out compounds which **do not** make key interactions and (2) reranking the compounds based on the score of the pose that *does* make those key interactions (assuming you have a binding hypothesis) using tools like [ProLIF](https://prolif.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)."
